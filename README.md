I have adapted the fantastic code from @kloggy to an ESP32 and an 8 relay board to have up to 8 zones. Also not using the Weather-related watering adjustments. No need given the weather patterns where I live :) This is work in progress since i need to add a second station for the other part of my yard (8 more zones) and intend to use the morning/afternoon cycles settings to activate Zone A and Zone B separately...
